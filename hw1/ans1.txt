Here are anwsers for lab questions. 


1. man -k 
followed by the string of that specific word 
e.g. man -k Eggert
I found this command by man man. 

2.
By whereis command, 
whereis cp
cp: 
/bin/cp 
/usr/share/man/man1/cp.1.gz 
/usr/share/man/man1p/cp.1p.gz

whereis wc
wc: 
/usr/bin/wc 
/usr/share/man/man1/wc.1.gz 
/usr/share/man/man1p/wc.1p.gz


3. 
this could be found by the command: find /usr/bin/ -name ? -executable 
/usr/bin/[
/usr/bin/w
/usr/bin/X
and what they do can be found by man command 

[ - bash built-in commands 
w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
X - no manual entry for X in seasnet server, 
but on ubuntu, it is a portable, network-transparent window system  

4. 
I use readlink /usr/bin/emacs
and this will show its link to /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. 
man chmod to see full definition of users and specific meaning of options.
allow group user to set user or group ID on execution.  
remove other users who are not in user's group to execuate this file.  

6. 
man find
then I found the modified date of find command 

find .  -mtime 21

7.
man find 
in there I found a type option -type d, which can limit find to directory 
find . -type d -mtime -21

8. 
whereis find  #which will return the location of find
cd /usr/bin/  #goto where the find is 
then find . -type l
there will be a list of files that are symbolic links 
then I copied the names of those files into a word document(lol)
and found there are 247 files that are symbolic links 

9.
I used two ways to do this and to make sure I am right
What I found on lnxsrv was 

drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root    4096 Jul  2  2015 jvm-commmon

First way:
ls /usr/lib -lat
this will list the date by time and pick the oldest one

The second way(although not absolutely correct):
I first list all details of files into a file by command 
cd usr/lib
ls -l >~/file.txt
then sort the txt by month
sort -M ~/file.txt 
then look at the year and find the earliest file that was edited 


10.
man locale 
 
Defintion of locale: When invoked without arguments, 
locale displays the current locale  settings for each locale category 
(see locale(5)), based on the settings of the environment variables
 that control the locale (see locale(7)). (copied from manual) 
As a result, the data by locale are from setting of the environment variables. 

11. 
I used command C-h a and the search for the keyword sort, and this is what I got.

12.
By looking at cheatsheet and google, 
C-M-a go to the beginning of the function
C-M-b move backwards a sexp
C-M-c exit from a minibuffer(or inner recursive buffer)
c-M-d move to right of first parenthesis 
c-M-e move to the end of defun
c-m-f move forward to the  next sexp
c-m-h set region of current defun

13.
this command will have a "Quit" on the lower status bar. 
It will abort the unfinished keystrokes that previously typed in. 
for example, if I typed in C-X by mistake, I can use C-G to recall it.

14. 
basically, it is just "paste" previously deleted text. (cut-paste) 

15. 
I noticed two differences

First, emacs will have two additional lines for current and parent directory
at the beginning

Second, ls is colored in many file names while emacs does not.
