Week 3 Homework Questions:

Q1: 
Brady removed this line because the program will not be calling 
this label for goto statement. Maybe because of some safety
reasons.I think it is unnecessary because the goto 
command is removed from the program and it will
 never be called anyway. 

Q2: 
it depends on the language that dcgettext can translate. 
Because Brady removed long_iso_time_style, the ls command 
will give a language that might be hard for non-native English
speaker to adopt.
Also, for programs that make use of that particular format might
have some inconsistency about the month. 

Q3.
I ran it by python randline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] 
 # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Because in the code, we can see an exception
if numlines <0:
   throw an error negative lines
but there is no valid exception for line = 0 
and when we open a file with 0 line 
we have undefined behavior. 

Q4. 
There is a syntax error in line 65:
except IOError as (errno, strerror):
       	       	  ^ invalid syntax 
Basically because of the difference of python3 and python2. 
I looked it up and found python 3 does not have automatic 
tuple unpacking which python 2 has. 
correct form should be 
except IOError as err:
