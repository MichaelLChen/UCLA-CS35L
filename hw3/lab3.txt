Week 3
-------------------------------------------------------------
Following Brady's workaround,

1. Grab Coreutils 7.6
First, I downloaded by the link on assignment website
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
and untar it by
tar -xf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2. compile
I used ./configure ./make and ./make install first.
However, the installation was not successsful, with the error
./install: cannot create regular file `/usr/local/bin/
./install': Permission denied

Then I tried to use --prefix flag with a relative path and ran
into another error that the path is not recognized.

Then I used absolute path

./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classhen/35l/hw3/coreutils-7.6
which check the details about machine before installing
./make
which compiles all the code and create executables
./make intall
put executables into final directories
and it worked successfully

3. reproduce the error
First, check the correct version of Linux machine
$ ls -l /bin/bash
and end up with
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960616 Oct 17 03:05 /bin/bash

To reproduce the result, first I need to change locale
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
Then change directory to ./bin
and reproduce the result by
$ ./ls -l /bin/bash
and the result is
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960616 2016-10-17 03:05 /bin/bash

4. use emacs to reproduce Brady's patch
emacs patch
then copy Brady's diff file from --- to the end the website
and tried to patch it by
patch -p0 < patch
but there was an error can't find file to patch at input line 10
and make me to enter again, so I entered scr/ls.c and it worked.

5. recompile
cd src
make

with the following output
make  all-am
make[1]: Entering directory `/w/home.17/class/
classhen/35l/hw3/coreutils-7.6/src'
  CC     ls.o
  CCLD   dir
  CCLD   vdir
  CCLD   ls
make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.17/class/
classhen/35l/hw3/coreutils-7.6/src'

As we can see, only ls.o got recompiled by make command
and the rest was left unchanged, because we only patched
the ls.c.


6.check if the bug is fixed
then try ./ls -l /bin/bash in src and the bug is fixed
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960616 Oct 17 03:05 /bin/bash

then go back to where patch file in question 4 is

For a new file(I choose the patch file that I just wrote
by emacs):

cd ..
fixed version:
./src/ls -l ./patch
-rw-r--r-- 1 classhen class 1052 Apr 15 18:54 ./patch

unmodified version:
./bin/ls -l ./patch
-rw-r--r-- 1 classhen class 1052 2017-04-15 18:54 ./patch

For an old file:
I change patch's time stamp nearly two years ago(my seventeenth birthday)
touch patch -t 1505100000
and ls -l touch
-rw-r--r-- 1 classhen class 1052 May 10  2015 patch

fixed version:
./src/ls -l ./patch
-rw-r--r-- 1 classhen class 1052 May 10  2015 ./patch

unmodified version:
./bin/ls -l ./patch
-rw-r--r-- 1 classhen class 1052 2015-05-10 00:00 ./patch
