Lab 7
Lab partner: Brian Shen

1. Set up Ubuntu and OpenSSH

I entered BIOS and use DVD to install Ubuntu. 

After setting Ubuntu up, I install OpenSSH by
dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh 
but only server part is installed, 
then I run 
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
to install the rest

2. Setting up as a server 

First I need to generate a public key by
ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/keplerc/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/keplerc/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/keplerc/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/keplerc/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:+kKU0LtIx9w8NGd2S5v8Ae2lND+0iPogqpqLNoiuxo8 keplerc@keplerc
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|     .       .   |
|    . . o + + +..|
|     + * = +.Bo=.|
|    . B +  .=.+o.|
|   . + .S..  . ..|
|    . oo o    .  |
|+    .o . o      |
|+=o  ...   .     |
|BE=o.  ..        |
+----[SHA256]-----+

3. Setting up my partner's profile 

sudo useradd -d /home/brian -m brian
sudo passwd brian
sudo mkdir /home/brian/.ssh
cd /home/brian
sudo chown -R brian .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then install emacs and turn off password 
sudo apt-get install emacs
sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and change the option to no 


4. check ip address
ifconfig 
and take the inet address: 10.0.2.15
while my partner's address is 10.0.2.27

5. ...wait for my partner to be client

6. As a client
First I need to copy my public key to server by 
ssh-copy
then add private key to authentication so that I will not 
have to type again and again 

ssh -X kepler@10.0.2.27
then run the command $xterm 
the window of xterm pops out
it also works for 
$firefox
